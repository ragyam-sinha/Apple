## ⚠️ Notes

* Images are locally referenced — make sure the image files (`apple.jpg`, favicon, etc.) are in the correct paths.
* Paths like `C:\Users\ASUS\...` should be changed to relative paths for portability.
* The JavaScript file is included twice in the HTML; you may want to remove the duplicate script tag.
